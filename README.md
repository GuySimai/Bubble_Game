# Bubble_Project
## Project Description
I developed a bubble÷ø\ball game application where players can interact with various controls to add, remove, pause, and manage balls on the screen. The game includes several key features:

Add Ball: A player can enter their name and start the game, where each click on the button generates a new ball with random size, color, and movement patterns.
Remove Ball: Allows removing the last added ball while the other balls continue moving.
Pause Last Ball: Pauses the movement of the last ball added.
About Box: Displays a randomly chosen information box with unique font, text, and color for each interaction.
End Game: Clears the game board and prepares for a new game session.
Database Management: Utilizes ADO.NET or Entity Framework to store player data, including player names and play durations.

## Technologies Used
Visual Studio 2022 with .NET and C# for application development
ADO.NET / Entity Framework for database interactions
Bitmap and Graphics classes for rendering balls and animations
