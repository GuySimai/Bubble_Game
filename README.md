# Bubble_Project

## Project Description
I developed a bubble÷ø\ball game application where players can interact with various controls to add, remove, pause, and manage balls on the screen. The game includes several key features:

- Add Ball: A player can enter their name and start the game, where each click on the button generates a new ball with random size, color, and movement patterns.  
- Remove Ball: Allows removing the last added ball while the other balls continue moving.  
- Pause Last Ball: Pauses the movement of the last ball added.

- About Box: Displays a randomly chosen information box with unique font, text, and color for each interaction.

- End Game: Clears the game board and prepares for a new game session.
- Database Management: Utilizes ADO.NET or Entity Framework to store player data, including player names and play durations.

- Exit Game (E Button): Prompts the user to confirm exit with a message box. If confirmed, the application closes.
